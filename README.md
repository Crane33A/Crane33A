- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @SunJHBill
Don't try to contact with me too much because I'm "Diving".
What?
That you really want to??
Well,you have to understand the present situation of Chinese high school students.An examination is needed as an access
to the university.The competition is tough so I can't get access to electronic device until weekend! TT
If you really have to,my email:sunjiahesfls@163.com.Twitter/Facebook not available(These things haven't entered China sofar!)
......
That's all.
PS:Like Python and photographing.I always hold the view that single developers DO MATTER.Enterprises sometimes
  really don't play a good role in improving our lives.They overuse our personal information.
